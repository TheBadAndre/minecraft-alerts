# minecraft-alerts
A simple Minecraft Alerts with 2 command
//
This code written in NodeJS you can use within Replit.com (https://replit.com/~) 
by creating an empty project, obviously choosing NodeJS as the language.

What this code does is send two chat messages with two very simple commands, /start, /stop.

/start: will send as a response in the chat that the Minecraft server is online, otherwise /stop will write the opposite, that is, the Minecraft server is offline
